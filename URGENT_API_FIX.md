# üö® URGENT: API Authentication Issue

## Problem
Your bot cannot execute trades because the API authentication is failing with error code 33004.

## Diagnosis Results
- ‚ùå API key fails on TESTNET (401 authentication error)
- ‚ùå API key fails on MAINNET (33004 "expired" error)
- ‚úÖ Public endpoints work (can get BTC price)

## Root Cause
The API credentials are not working. Despite your belief that the key is not expired, Bybit's servers are rejecting it.

## IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

### Option 1: Create Fresh API Credentials (Recommended)
1. Log into https://www.bybit.com (NOT testnet)
2. Go to **Account & Security** ‚Üí **API Management**
3. **Delete** the old API key (if it exists)
4. Click **Create New Key**
5. Select **System-generated API Keys**
6. Choose **API v5** (Unified Trading Account)
7. Set permissions:
   - ‚úÖ **Read-Write** for Orders
   - ‚úÖ **Read-Write** for Positions  
   - ‚úÖ **Read** for Account (Wallet)
8. **IMPORTANT**: Select **Derivatives API** not Spot
9. For IP restriction, either:
   - Leave it as "No restriction" (less secure but works everywhere)
   - Or add Railway's IP addresses (more secure)
10. Copy the new API Key and Secret immediately

### Option 2: Check Existing Key Settings
If you're certain the key isn't expired:
1. Log into Bybit ‚Üí API Management
2. Find your API key and check:
   - **Expiry date**: Is there one set?
   - **API type**: Must be "Derivatives" not "Spot"
   - **Permissions**: Must have Orders, Positions enabled
   - **IP Whitelist**: Either disabled or includes your IPs
   - **Status**: Must be "Active" not "Expired" or "Disabled"

### Option 3: Railway Environment Variables
Double-check in Railway:
1. Go to your Railway project
2. Click on **Variables** tab
3. Verify:
   - `BYBIT_API_KEY` has no extra spaces/newlines
   - `BYBIT_API_SECRET` has no extra spaces/newlines
   - `BYBIT_TESTNET=false` (must be lowercase "false")

## Testing Your Fix
After updating credentials, the bot should:
1. Successfully connect to Bybit
2. Show your $250 balance
3. Start generating and executing trades

## Current Code Status
‚úÖ Code is working correctly with:
- tpslMode parameter fixed
- Aggressive strategy implemented
- All parameters from environment variables
- Proper order formatting

The ONLY issue is the API authentication. Once you fix the credentials, trades will execute.
