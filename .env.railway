# Railway Redis Configuration
# 
# Railway provides Redis with internal DNS that only works within Railway's network
# You need to use the connection string from your Railway Redis service

# Option 1: Using Railway's internal network (for production)
# Get this from your Railway Redis service variables
REDIS_URL=${{Redis.REDIS_URL}}

# Option 2: Using public URL (if you exposed Redis publicly - not recommended)
# REDIS_URL=${{Redis.REDIS_PUBLIC_URL}}

# Option 3: Manual configuration
# Replace with your actual Redis credentials from Railway dashboard
# REDIS_URL=redis://default:[YOUR_PASSWORD]@[YOUR_REDIS_HOST]:6379

# For local development, use:
# REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0
